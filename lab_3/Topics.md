Methods to correct uneven illumination:

CLAHE

Homomorphic filtering

Local gamma correction

Denoising operations:

Gaussian noise addition & removal (Gaussian smoothing filter)

Salt-and-pepper noise addition & removal (Median filter)

Shot noise addition & removal (Non-local means filter)

Histogram analysis of noisy vs. denoised outputs
