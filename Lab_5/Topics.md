### Lab 5 – Edge Detection, Corner & Shape Identification
Canny Edge Detection with different threshold values (50, 100)

Comparison of edge detection methods:

Canny vs. Laplacian vs. Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)

Evaluation using Precision, Recall, and F1-score

Harris Corner Detection:

Applied on images (corner, building, pyramid)

Printing R values for detected corners

Hough Transform methods:

Standard Hough Transform (SHT)

Probabilistic Hough Transform (PHT)

Line and circle detection (line, building, coin images)
