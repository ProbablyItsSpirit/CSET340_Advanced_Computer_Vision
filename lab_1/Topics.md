### Lab 1 – Basic Image Manipulations -

Reading RGB images, extracting channels, plotting, and analyzing shape/size

Converting RGB to grayscale and binary images

Region of Interest (ROI) extraction

Arithmetic operations:

Image addition (brightness enhancement)

Image subtraction (motion detection, defect detection)

Image multiplication (masking, brightness/contrast enhancement)

Logical operations:

XOR for similarity checking

Comparison of subtraction vs. division, and subtraction vs. XOR

Video frame extraction and sampling at different frame rates
